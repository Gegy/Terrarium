# Terrarium
Terrarium is a mod that generates the real world in Minecraft. It is a rewrite of [Earth](https://github.com/gegy1000/Earth).

## Usage
Terrarium implements a new world type for this generation. The generation can be customized through a GUI, to adjust settings such as scale or what should generate.

Data tiles are downloaded from the various sources as you explore them, so lag may occur when new tiles are being loaded. Once they have been downloaded, however, these tiles are cached locally to be used again later.

To navigate to a real location, you can make use of the `geotp` command.
This command allows navigation to any real place on earth.

It can be used with latitude & longitude coordinates:
 - `/geotp 27.987746 86.924812`
 
Or it can be used with a place name:
 - `/geotp Mount Everest`
 
Additionally, you can make use of the `geotool` command, which provides various utilities for navigating the world. It provides a UI to display where you currently are, and a UI to teleport to a new location with a map.
